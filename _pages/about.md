I am Bernat and I work at the intersection of data science and software engineering. Mine has been (and it is still is) a journey of beautiful discoveries. I started in physics and eventually transitioned to data science and software development. Today, I strive to embed machine learning into software solutions to help people and organizations alike focus on what matters. I thrive the most when working within diverse and multidisciplinary teams and I believe in the value of Lean and XP software principles.

Curiosity driven, virtually everything interests me. This has exposed me to a myriad of technologies, frameworks and tools and it has also led me into a never-ending quest for learning and personal growth. I always enjoy engaging discussions, so please reach out to me if you want to talk about anything you find interesting.

Also, I like to ski. Ah, I love skiing.
