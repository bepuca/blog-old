    "Now that we have the data, we need to **build** the system that we will implement to KVN, we need to build the neural network! So far, the only network that we have seen had one (dummy) input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer. There are different types of layers. The one that is fully connected to the previous and the next layer (as the ones we have seen) is called **Dense** in Keras. For now, we will stick to this simple **architechture** (i.e. network structure) and see if it works. That is, our neural network will be constituted by:\n",

    "The choice of $n=30$ neurons in the hidden layer is rather arbitrary. Nonetheless, the number of neurons on the output layer is directly related to the number of categories we want for KVN to learn. Since we have $10$ categories (digits), we need $10$ neurons. The idea is that KVN's guess will be related to the neuron that has the higher activation. If the neuron corresponding to the digit 3 is the one with the higher activation, KVN is saying: *\"A 3!\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras allows us to build our neural network in a very intuitive way. We generate what is called a *Sequential* model that basically lets us to add layers sequentially. When we add layers, there are ways to initialize the weights and biases (i.e. the parameter set) with different distributions. Nonetheless, we won't focus on this. Despite that, know that the initialization can influence the learning procedure. This makes sense since the initialization determines where in the mountain we start our downhill!\n",

    "Well, as we can see above, KVN got trouble learning to identify digits of rather poor handwritting but correctly identified more standard ones. So, for now, I think we can say that KVN did a good job!\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay okay, good compared to what? The most trivial system would be to randomly pick a class. That is, that when we show KVN an image he randomly says a digit. In that case, he will be right, on average, $10 \\%$ of the time (because we have $10$ classes). So our system is quite better than the random system! Nonetheless, *how good is the accuracy* heavily depends on the problem. If we were trying to identify if a patient has cancer, for instance, this accuracy might still be too low. For the case at hand, that accuracy will absolutely do for good old Margaret.\n",
